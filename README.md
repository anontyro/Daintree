# Daintree
A Spring boot test site

This Daintree application was my first Spring Boot attempt which came after I explored the world of Spring MVC.
I found out that Spring Boot could offer a nicer experience in developing sites to enable rapid development and deployment.

I learnt a lot from this project as I worked to create a basic CRUD operation allowing for user management which tied into
the User Authentication part of the application. 

The templating engine I am using is JSP generally because that is the most common in the job market in Singapore.

I learnt a lot from this application and aim to apply that knowledge in future more advanced projects.
